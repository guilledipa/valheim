# Anthos Configuration Management Directory

[documentation](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/repo)

The `clusterregistry/` directory is optional, and contains configs for 
`ClusterSelectors`. `ClusterSelectors` limit which clusters a config applies to,
and are referenced in configs found in the `cluster/` and `namespaces/`
directories.
